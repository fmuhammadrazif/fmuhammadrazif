# Hello World! 

Currently based in Jakatya and pursuing a degree in Computer Science, I am deeply passionate about the world of technology and software development. My curiosity and eagerness to learn drive me to constantly explore new things, and I am excited to continue to develop my skills and leverage my knowledge to build innovative solutions that push the boundaries of what is possible. I am always seeking opportunities to collaborate with like-minded individuals and contribute to meaningful projects that make a positive impact on the world.

I am open for collaboration and work opportunities! Let's connect through [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/muhammad-razif-firmansyah).
